# A statically generated blog example using Next.js and WordPress

This example showcases Next.js's [Static Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) feature using [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) as the data source.

#### Optional: Add WPGraphiQL

The [WPGraphiQL](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphiql) plugin gives you access to a GraphQL IDE directly from your WordPress Admin, allowing you to inspect and play around with the GraphQL API.

The process to add WPGraphiQL is the same as the one for WPGraphQL: Go to the [WPGraphiQL repo](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphiql), download the ZIP archive, and install it as a plugin in your WordPress site. Once that's done you should be able to access the GraphiQL page in the admin:

### Step 2. Populate Content

Inside your WordPress admin, go to **Posts** and start adding new posts:

- We recommend creating at least **2 posts**
- Use dummy data for the content
- Pick an author from your WordPress users
- Add a **Featured Image**. You can download one from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
- Fill the **Excerpt** field

### Step 4. Run Next.js in development mode

```bash
npm install
npm run dev

# or

yarn install
yarn dev
```

Your blog should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)! If it doesn't work, post on [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions).

Copy the `refreshToken` returned by the mutation, then open `.env.local`, and make the following changes:

- Uncomment `WORDPRESS_AUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN` and set it to be the `refreshToken` you just received.
- Uncomment `WORDPRESS_PREVIEW_SECRET` and set it to be any random string (ideally URL friendly).

Your `.env.local` file should look like this:

```bash
WORDPRESS_API_URL=...

**Important:** Restart your Next.js server to update the environment variables.

### Step 7. Deploy on Vercel

You can deploy this app to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).

#### Deploy Your Local Project

To deploy your local project to Vercel, push it to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket and [import to Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example).

**Important**: When you import your project on Vercel, make sure to click on **Environment Variables** and set them to match your `.env.local` file.
